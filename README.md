# DownsamplingChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.13.

We have many more data points than pixels in the plots, and need to downsample the timeseries to no more than a 1000 datapoints, for the second chart. Modify the 'returnDownsampledData' method in 'src/chart/chart.component.ts', in order to achieve this. Ideally the downsampled chart should be nearly visually identical, to the original.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
